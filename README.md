# Goal: to add bluethooth to the RPi with and FPGA
I just was able to get the first Ultibo example working on the microbit & bare metal
RPi3B  https://github.com/develone/microbit-_test/blob/master/first_ex_mark/pic/a.jpeg
& https://github.com/develone/microbit-_test/blob/master/first_ex_mark/pic/b.jpeg
When you press the buttons on the microbit it displays A or B sends the indication on
The RPi3B.  Microbit 16 MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller, 256 KB flash memory, 
16 KB static ram, 2.4 GHz Bluetooth, Accelerometer, Magnetometer, 25 LEDs in a 5Ã—5 array,
Three tactile pushbuttons (two for user, one for reset).  
The micro bit can be program from cell phone using the Bluetooth.  I have been able to 
test the example find my phone which when y press a Button Use the phone to tell you here I am.
