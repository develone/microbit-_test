1. Download the hex file from this page to your computer.
0250_kl26z_microbit_0x8000.hex
copied to notes_txt
2. Then with the battery pack removed and a USB lead connected, hold the reset button at the back 
of the micro:bit and plug the USB lead into your computer. You should see a drive appear in your 
file manager called MAINTENANCE.

3. Drag and drop the .HEX you downloaded form this page onto the micro:bit and wait for the 
yellow system LED on the back of the device to stop flashing. When the upgrade is completed, 
the micro:bit will reset, ejecting itself from the computer and re-appear in normal MICROBIT drive mode.

4. Finally, check the DETAILS.TXT file that is on the MICROBIT drive and make sure that it has the 
same version number as the .HEX firmware that you just downloaded and flashed to the interface chip.
